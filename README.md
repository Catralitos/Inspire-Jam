# Inspire Jam

In Pummeling A La Carte, Kai a young apprentice, and his sidekick Nuggie enter a cooking competition in which the winner will receive a legendary ingredient among the cooks, but first, he will have to defeat many competitors including the champion.

The gameplay consists of Pokémon-inspired Battles where players instead of using menus, draw their commands in Okami style. There are 6 commands: attack, defend heal, fish, meat, vegetables.

Though mixing these may yield interesting results... 

This game was developed for the Inspire Jam 2022, and we were primarily inspired by Final Fantasy VI, Pokémon and Okami.
